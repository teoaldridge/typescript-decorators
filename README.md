# typescript-decorators
In this exercise, I learned how to use TypeScript Decorators

I did this exercise as part of my studies with 'Understanding Typescript' by Maximillian Schwarzmuller:
https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- Wht are Decorators and how to use them
- Workin with Decorator Factories
- Building useful Decorators
- Adding multiple Decorators
- Property Decorators
- Accessor and Parameter Decorators
- When do Decorators execute?
- Returning and changing a class in a Class Decorator
- other Decorator Return Types
- Validation with Decorators

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
- In terminal type 'tsc --watch' to continuously compile all changes you make in the TS files to the JS files.
